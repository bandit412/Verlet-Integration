# Verlet-Integration

## Introduction
I was intrigued by a student demo project in which they used Verlet Integration. The students premise was this was a much better approach to linear motion than was discussed in class. Having some time on my hands I decided to investigate this topic. What I found was the math used in Verlet Integration was not that much different than what I taught. I first created the **VerletConsole** project to do a simple test of the math. Once the initial testing was completed, I created the **VerletDraw** project and moved code from the VerletConsole project into a Class Library project so that both runnable projects had access to the same Verlet functions.

## Reference
I used the [Verlet Integration](https://www.algorithm-archive.org/contents/verlet_integration/verlet_integration.html) reference as a basis for this project.
